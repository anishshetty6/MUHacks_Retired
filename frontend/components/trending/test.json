Amid this mass erasure of public information, the Internet Archive is racing to save copies of those deleted resources. \n\nThe San Francisco-based nonprofit operates the Wayback Machine, a popular tool that saves snapshots of websites that may otherwise be lost forever, and it has archived federal government websites at each presidential transition since 2004. \n\nWhile it's normal for a new administration to overhaul some of its online resources, the Trump administration's pace of destruction has shocked many archivists. \"There have been thousands and thousands of pages removed,\" says Mark Graham, director of the Wayback Machine, who notes that even a page about the U.S. Constitution was scrubbed from the White House website.",

After all, it isnt difficult to type up a response and send it, right? It truly isn't. I've been trying to come up with a way non civil servants will understand the problem, so I've created this analogy. Let's say you are a delivery driver (FedEx, UPS, Amazon, etc). From Monday to Friday, 8-5 you drive around, delivering packages.  Your company tracks your truck via satellite, your deliveries via various IT programs, and they know what you are doing because they plan your route, tell you where to drive, and check your truck at the end of the day to confirm you delivered all your packages. Now let's say after a long week of work, you are relaxing at home with your family on a Saturday night, getting ready for bed, and you get a random email at 11pm from your state's dept of labor. The email comes from drive@labor.state and is automatically flagged by your company's email as coming from outside your organization. The email says that within 48 hrs, you have to send them a list of 5 places you drove over the past week. Keep in mind, this didnt come from your supervisor, or the leader of your individual company, but from an organization that has nothing to do with the packages you deliver or even package delivery services in general. The email has a generic return email and no signature block identifying who actually sent the email.  Your boss didn't know you were going to be asked for this information,  your boss's boss didn't know, even the leader of your company didn't know about the email. And let's not forget that the Dept of Labor has no real need to know where you drove this week.Your decide to look online and see if anyone else got the email, and end up following a link to the personal social media page of someone that works at the Dept of Labor. From this personal social media page, you learn that the email was sent to every delivery driver in the country and that if you don't respond by the deadline, you will be fired. You don't go back to work until Monday, so you spend the rest of Saturday and all of Sunday wondering why you are receiving this email and being asked where you drove, and why you are being threatened with being fired of you dont respond to a random email that came from outside your chain of command. You worry that if you don't describe your drive/route in enough detail, you will be fired. You worry that your supervisor only gave you 10 packages to deliver one day, when another route delivered 30, so maybe you will be fired because you were given fewer packages to deliver and there can't describe an impressive route as part of your 5 bullet points of driving. When you return to work on Monday, the deadline looming over your head, your boss tells you not to respond to the email. And hour later, your boss's boss tells you that you MUST respond. And then just before quitting time, the leader of your company sends you an email that you are NOT to respond.  Meanwhile, you know full well that all of your deliveries were appropriately tracked to confirm delivery, and your entire route along (with every stop) can be verified by reviewing the GPS records on your delievry truck. This is why the 5 bullet email is concerning to federal employees. </p><p>------</p><p><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/fednews/comments/1j1fhd6/5_bullet_impact_explained_to_non_feds/?utm_source=ifttt\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" translate=\"no\" target=\"_blank\"><span class=\"invisible\">https://www.</span><span class=\"ellipsis\">reddit.com/r/fednews/comments/</span><span class=\"invisible\">1j1fhd6/5_bullet_impact_explained_to_non_feds/?utm_source=ifttt</span></a></p><p>r/fednews is the main subreddit for US Federal government workers.</p><p>This robot is NOT affiliated with r/fednews.
